There are n hotels along the beautiful Adriatic coast. Each hotel has its value in Euros.

Peter has won m Euros on the lottery. Now he wants to buy a sequence of consecutive hotels, such that the sum of the
values of these consecutive hotels is as great as possible – but not greater than m.

You are to calculate this greatest possible total value.

## Input
In the first line there are integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 300 000, 1 ≤ m < 231). In the next line there are n positive
integers less than 106, representing the hotel values in the order they lie along the coast.

## Output
Print the required number (it will be greater than 0 in all the test data).

## Example

| Input              | Output |
|:-------------------|:------:|
| 5 12<br/>2 1 3 4 5 |   12   |
